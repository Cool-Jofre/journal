1. zip2john seems to turn the unreadable zip file into a format which john can understand. I looked inside both the crack.zip file and the crack.txt (this is the output of 
zip2john) and the format is completely different.

2. john seems to be able to test hashes by trying out any number of characters to see if the developed hash is the same as the password hash.

3. The complexity and length of a password changes the amount of time it takes to crack it. A simple password with repeating characters would be easier to replicate when 
compared to a long and character rich password. The time it takes also depends on the uniqueness of the password. If the password which is being cracked is super complex but 
common, it will easily be cracked since the tool JohnTheRipper will be able to use a dictionary attack.
