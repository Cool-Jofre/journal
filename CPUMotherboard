Give 2 examples of when it might be helpful to know a processor's maximum clock speed and the amount of addressable RAM.
 If I were to create a computer, I would want to make sure that the CPU’s clock speed is passable and if the CPU can handle the amount of memory I intend to use. This is to 
 avoid having a CPU that supports up to 16 GB of memory while having 32 GB
 On the field as a Digital Forensics specialist, knowing how much memory there is could aid in determining if a system which cannot be taken down is worth investigating. 
 The normal procedure is to unplug the computer to prevent data loss, but this makes it so all the data on the RAM is lost.

How might it be helpful to use a tool like the CPU stress test we used in part 2 of this lab?
 If I was a CPU salesman it would be a good way to display how CPUs compared to each other. Showing how a program can handle stress can be a very good model for customers 
 who cannot grasp the theoretical limits of the hardware. 

In part 3 of this lab you researched a CPU from a device other than a desktop computer. What strategy might you use when purchasing these types of devices to make choices 
about which one to purchase?
 I chose a game console, and I can now understand why the system is so limited in its speed and graphics. For the next handheld console, I’m going to look for one which can 
 handle a great amount of stress from games and isn’t as anti-consumer as Nintnendo. 

What are the names of the processors you referenced in this lab. Some were manufactured by Intel, one was of your choosing, 
 Intel Core i7-10710U
 Intel Celeron Processor 7305:
 Intel Xeon Gold 6418H
 ARM11 Co-Processor
 ARM9 Processor
