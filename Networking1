Since we were able to connect with servers from across the world, I would like to know how we can request information from servers from across the world. 

I did some research into MAC addresses, and they seem like “burnt in” network addresses. Since this address is unchangeable without specialized software, 
this could be useful during investigations. I wonder how I can request the MAC address of another device to see what they are.

It also seems like Netstat can be used to discover unwanted connections between your system and malicious systems. I can see myself using this, or something
more sophisicated, in the future for digital investigations on a live system.
