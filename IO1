Performance Monitor:
  This program allows certain statistics of the computer. These activities it tracks are plotted on a line graph, and this program can be used to create reports of a computer 
  over specified time lengths. 

Interrupt Requests:
  A signal will be sent from the I/O device to the system and request the system to stop doing anything and focus on the new request. 

I/O Ports:
  Ports which will intake or output information to external devices. Input devices are like mice and keyboards, while output devices are like speakers or monitors. 

What are counters used for?
  How the performance monitor tallies the amount of activity a certain action on the computer is having. An example of a counter is interrupts/sec, which would capture the 
  amount of interrupts the system is experiencing every second. 

What is a Data COllector Set and how might it be used?
  This is used to collect certain information over time. It can be used to see if thereâ€™s a problem with the system since you have a baseline to compare the current system 
  to. It can also be used to see any unusual traffic which might be communicating with aspects of the computer.
