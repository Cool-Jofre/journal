1. Hexadecimal, or base 16, is the numerical system used for MAC addresses.

2. ROM is read only, making it so it cannot be modified. Though it seems like macchanger just masks the original mac address with a new one, not replacing the old one.

3. The frequency they connect to the network and at what time could also provide some details to who may be exploiting the network. If I saw a laptop made by Dell get used on the cameras, 
but a Dell MAC address never shows up in any records, it could be seen as suspicious and a good starting point.
