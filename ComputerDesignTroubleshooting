1.	Post codes are a series of steps which check hardware for errors. My computer has a little screen on the motherboard and displayed the steps POST went through went 
  conducting error checking.

2.	The BIOS is the Basic Input/Output System. It is held in a chip on the motherboard with its own software loaded onto it. This is necessary since it will load the OS and 
  has instructions to interact with input/output devices like a mouse or keyboard.

3.	Thin client workstations are those which run off servers. Instead of doing things natively, it would be done offshore on a server which saves on costs for making thin 
  clients but requires that thin client to be able to connect to the server. Thick clients are workstations which run the programs natively, allowing them to work offline. 
  These are more expensive but are far more common than thin clients since many companies do not have a server set up for thin clients to work. 

4.	Modular and non-modular PSU are a very important distinction when choosing a PSU. A non-modular has soldered cables which allows for quicker installation but can reduce 
  overall airflow. Modular PSUs allow you to plug in cables at your own will, allowing you to not use some redundant cables. The efficiency of a PSU is also an important factor 
  to check. A higher-grade efficiency would use less power and generate less heat which is important to the longevity of the computer.
