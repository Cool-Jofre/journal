Scripting is the process of turning multiple commands into a single command.
This would make it more efficent, and with parameters, allow the user to have
these scripts be very applicible to many different situations.
I had also did a little digging, and it seems like all CMD usability has been
ported over to PowerShell, making it more usable overall since its more able
to use third-party scripts.

I booted up PowerShell on my laptop, and instictivly typed in "ls" since I an
used to only using that command, and it worked in PowerShell. I haven't really
tested out PowerShell much, but from what I have researched, its much more
flexible than CMD prompt.

The command, xcopy, can be super useful when moving a great deal of information
since the File Explorer GUI can get a little buggy when moving subdirectiories
into other locations. 

I can also see myself using md and rd in scripts to create automated ways to
move information and reduce clutter from my desktop. Since all my files have
a patern, I could easily create an archives folder.
