Vol.exe seems to be able to parse through images to find certain information depending on the user’s request. I used the command imagine info which allowed me to gain 
information about a certain image.

Images seem to be a snapshot of something. Like RAM images are a snapshot of what happened at that very moment. A computer disk image is a snapshot of what happened at the 
very moment the image was taken.

Syntax are the rules around how commands are delivered. Syntax is necessary since computers are not very smart and need exact directions on how things should be done.

A path is a set of directions a computer can take from the root, the very base of the computer, to a place. This is to prevent confusion on the computer’s part if you have 
any directories with the same name.

When files are zipped, the files which were zipped are now taking up less space since they’re compressed. To access a zipped file, the user must undo the compression and this 
process is called extracting.

This is when the information on the RAM is copied to the hard drive.
