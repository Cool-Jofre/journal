1.	Define 3 terms or concepts used in this lab:
 a.	Thread – To aid in distributing processor time, threads are the units which are given to programs to gain time on the processor. 
 b.	Processes – A program on the computer. Programs require resources to work.
 c.	Parent Process – A process which has smaller processes within them. In the lab these were shown as the processes with the drop-down button next to them.

2.	For each process in the main window, what does the Process Monitor display (column headers), other than the Process ID (PID) and explain what these are (you can look 
these up in an outside resource)?
 a.	“Process” is the name of the process currently running and aids you in finding child processes within parent processes.
 b.	“CPU” displays the percentage of the CPU running for a certain task. 
 c.	“Private Bytes” displays how much memory is dedicated to that program specifically. 
 d.	“Working Set” displays the amount of data recently referenced in. 
 e.	“Description” displays a short summary of what the process is.
 f.	“Company Name” Displays the name of the company who developed the process.
