1. The “r” or read permission protects the contents of a file. When a user is missing the read permission, they are unable to access the contents of a file, 
making it so the user cannot learn anything within it.

2. The integrity of the file is upheld by the “w” or write permission. Only those who are given permission to write can change the contents of a file. When a 
person without permission tries to edit a file, they will be denied the ability to.

3. The “x” or execute permission makes it so certain scripts are not usable for certain users. Certain programs or scripts have the ability to create and delete 
directories/files, which could be detrimental to the system. If a mistake is made by someone, like putting in incorrect parameters, it could be terrible since 
they would have accidentally deleted a lot of information with only one command. By limiting the commands a user can use, it will limit the amount of mistakes which 
are avoidable.
