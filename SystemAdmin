1. Explain how someone might use the Task Scheduler maliciously.

    are running to capture images of personal information. 

2. How might the Event Viewer be useful when investigating a security incident?
a. Since each action leaves a trail in the event viewer, when something odd happens on the system it should end up recorded in the event viewer. This could give investigators
    a way to discover sources of intrusion or what may have been damaged/stolen during a security incident.
