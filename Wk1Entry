Binary = A system of counting which only uses 1's and 0's. For me at first I didn't think it was very wise to use just two symbols to represent numbers in a system, but it must reflect the states of on and off which a computer is subject to. 
It also looks like if you want to calculate any binary digit's number you want to do (s * 2 ^ p) where s is the symbol, one or zero, and p is the places away from the rightmost symbol the target symbol is.  

Hexadecimal = A system where a symbol can equal 16 different numbers. I'm not too sure what the use of this kind of counting is but you can store a greater deal of numbers in a smaller size. 

Binary and Hexadecimal are both different forms of counting which are used with computing. Binary is a counting system with only two symbols, a 1 and 0. If you want to calculate any binary digit's 
number you want to do (s * 2 ^ p) where s is the symbol, one or zero, and p is the places away from the rightmost symbol the target symbol is. This would allow you to convert 1011 into four different equations.
(1 * 2 ^ 3) + (0 * 2 ^ 2) + (1 * 2 ^ 1) + (1 * 2 ^ 0) which is the same as 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 or 11. It seems like this type of counting mirrors the internal off and on nature of computers. Hexadecimal works very similarly,
but instead of (s * 2 ^ p) it uses (s * 16 ^ p). Hexadecimal also uses six extra characters which our decimal system does not use, A, B, C, D, E, and F. If i wanted to convert 5F30 into decimal I would do four equations
(5 * 16 ^ 3) + (F * 16 ^ 2) + (3 * 16 ^ 1) + (0 * 16 ^ 0). This is equvalant to 20,480 + 3840 + 48 + 0 or 24,368.
