1. What are 3 ways Linux is different from Windows?
  a.A great deal of the utility Linux provides is found by using the terminal emulator. Windows does not push the user to use the command prompt like Linux does. 

  b. Linux comes with a lot less fluff when compared to Windows. When I installed Windows 11 on my laptop, I was given a great deal of bloatware created by Windows. 
  Linux operating systems usually come barebones or only with utilities which the distro of the OS need.

  c. Linux projects are mostly open sourced, which is a completely different approach when compared to the proprietary Windows. Due to the open source nature, groups
  have came together to develop distribution of Linux, while Windows only has one main distribution which evolves over time. 

2. GNU stands for Gnu’s Not Unix, which is an open source operating system started in 1984. This is the precursor to Linux operating systems. 

3. Linux was written to be a “complete Unix-compatible software”. This was the first line of the “Initial Announcement” found on the gnu.org website.

4. A distro is a type of Linux. There are many different types which serve different people. Some like Ubuntu are meant for everyday use while others like Kali are 
meant for more specialized uses. 

5. “Dual booting” is the act of changing the boot order in your BIOS to make certain operating systems boot before others. 

6. A package is compressed software. It is similar to packages in programming like Python where you get access to certain functionalities by installing it and using it. 

7. “Root” is the most powerful user on the computer. They are able to do any action on the computer since they’re unrestricted. Every system needs one since many actions require 
root privileges.
